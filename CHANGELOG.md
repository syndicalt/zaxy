# Changelog

All notable Zaxy release changes are recorded here.

## 0.2.0b1 - 2026-05-15

- Promoted Zaxy to its first beta packaging track with clean CI, release smoke, beta readiness, and trusted PyPI publishing gates.
- Hardened model-facing memory UX with Memory Bootstrap, Memory Checkout diagnostics, feedback guidance, source-aware context assembly, and shared checkout policy across core and MCP paths.
- Expanded deterministic capture and onboarding with local Codex capture, hook status coverage, leak detection, happy-path infrastructure profiles, and clean-repo UAT.
- Improved graph projection and auditability with hash-linked Eventloom event paths, source citation edges, temporal entity version edges, inferred-edge audit metadata, and graph projection integrity checks.
- Added and archived MemPalace-comparable benchmark evidence, including guardrails for mean score, Answer@5, Recall@5, citation coverage, and latency budgets.
- Hardened long-memory retrieval and synthesis to reach the current archived beta benchmark report: mean 0.950, Answer@5 0.950, citation coverage 1.000, and R@1/R@5/R@10 0.990.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-11

- Published the first public `zaxy-memory` package on PyPI.
- Added the `zaxy` console script for local onboarding, memory inspection, MCP serving, capture, projection, benchmarking, and release operations.
- Switched the publish workflow to PyPI Trusted Publishing so future releases use GitHub OIDC instead of long-lived PyPI API tokens.
- Shipped the current alpha memory substrate: Eventloom-backed provenance, Neo4j projection, Memory Checkout, deterministic capture, local onboarding, hooks, packet capture as an optional path, and benchmark tooling.
